## üéØ Areas for Contribution

### High Priority
- **3D Primitives**: Add new geometric shapes and housing elements
- **AI Commands**: Extend natural language processing capabilities
- **UI/UX**: Improve user interface and interactions
- **Performance**: Optimize 3D rendering and state management

### Medium Priority

- **Advanced Materials**: PBR materials and textures

## üìù Coding Standards

### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Provide proper type definitions
- Avoid `any` types when possible
- Use interfaces for object structures

### React
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Implement proper error boundaries

### 3D/Babylon.js
- Use the existing `sceneManager` pattern
- Follow imperative-to-declarative bridging patterns
- Properly dispose of 3D resources
- Use the established object factory pattern

### State Management
- Use Zustand store for global state
- Keep state minimal and normalized
- Use actions for state mutations
- Implement proper getters for derived state

### Styling
- Use the existing CSS patterns
- Follow responsive design principles
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Use CSS variables for theming

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing
- Test all 3D interactions (create, select, transform)
- Verify AI command processing
- Check responsive design on different screen sizes
- Test keyboard shortcuts and accessibility

### Automated Testing
- Add unit tests for utility functions
- Test React components with React Testing Library
- Mock 3D scene interactions appropriately
- Test state management logic

## üìö Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Document all public functions and classes
- Use JSDoc for TypeScript documentation
- Include examples for complex functions
- Document architectural decisions

### User Documentation
- Update README.md for new features
- Add examples to ARCHITECTURE.md
- Create tutorials for complex workflows
- Update keyboard shortcuts list

## üêõ Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:
- **Environment**: OS, browser, Node.js version
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed reproduction steps
- **Expected Behavior**: What should happen
- **Actual Behavior**: What actually happens
- **Screenshots**: Visual evidence if applicable
- **Console Logs**: Any error messages

## üí° Feature Requests

For feature requests, please provide:

- **Proposed Solution**: How should it work?
- **Alternatives**: Other approaches considered
- **Implementation**: Technical approach if known

## üîß Architecture Guidelines

### Adding New 3D Objects
1. Define type in `src/types/types.ts`
2. Add factory function in `src/babylon/objectFactory.ts`
3. Update UI controls in `App.tsx`
4. Add to housing factory if applicable

### Extending AI Commands
1. Add command type to `src/ai/ai.service.ts`
2. Update system prompt with new capabilities
3. Implement command handler in scene store
4. Add error handling and validation

### UI Component Development
1. Create in appropriate `src/components/` directory
2. Connect to store using `useSceneStore()`
3. Follow existing styling patterns
4. Add proper accessibility attributes

## ü§ù Community
