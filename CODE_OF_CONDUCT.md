## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including:

* GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions, wiki)
* Project communication channels
* Community events and meetups
* Social media interactions related to the project
* Any other forums where community members represent the project

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project team members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the project community.

## Building a Positive Community

We believe that a positive community leads to better software. Here's how we can build that together:

### For Contributors
* **Ask questions** - Don't be afraid to ask for help or clarification
* **Share knowledge** - Help others learn and grow
* **Be patient** - Code reviews and discussions take time
* **Celebrate successes** - Acknowledge good work and contributions
* **Learn from mistakes** - Everyone makes mistakes; focus on improvement

### For Maintainers
* **Be welcoming** - Make newcomers feel valued and included
* **Provide clear guidance** - Help contributors understand expectations
* **Give constructive feedback** - Focus on the work, not the person
* **Recognize contributions** - Acknowledge all forms of contribution
* **Lead by example** - Model the behavior you want to see

## Specific Guidelines for 3D/Technical Discussions

Given the technical nature of 3D modeling and AI integration:

* **Be patient with technical explanations** - Complex 3D concepts can be hard to grasp
* **Share resources** - Link to helpful tutorials, documentation, or examples
* **Avoid elitism** - Everyone has different levels of 3D modeling experience
* **Encourage experimentation** - 3D development often involves trial and error
* **Be specific in feedback** - Provide actionable suggestions for improvement
